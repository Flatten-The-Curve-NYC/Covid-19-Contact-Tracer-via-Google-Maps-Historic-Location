## Containment / Principles of Contact Tracking 
Containment is the best way to slow this epidemic. But for containment to be effective, it needs:
1. Rapid identification (and quarantine) of infected individuals, and 
1. Determining Close Contacts; the determination of whom they have had close contact within the previous days and weeks, and decontamination of locations the infected individual has visited. 

Rapid identification relies heavily on the availability of tests. Since virus testing is quite far out of our wheelhouse, we applaud all the companies that have moved quickly to make testing more ubiquitous and leave it at that!

On the other hand, determination of close contacts is something that we think software can have a big impact. With almost half of the world’s population carrying a device capable of GPS tracking, location trails – timestamped logs of an individual’s location -- are often automatically created. If you haven’t seen your Google Map’s location history check out: https://www.google.com/maps/timeline. 

By comparing a user’s location trails with those from diagnosed carriers of infectious disease, one can identify users who have been in close proximity to the diagnosed carrier and, if the exposed users take appropriate action, reduce the spread of the infectious disease. 

However, first-generation contact-tracing tools, deployed against the current 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis, can also be – and have been – used to expand mass surveillance, limit individual freedoms and expose the most private details about individuals. Citizencentric, privacy-first solutions that are open-source, secure, and decentralized (such as MIT Private Kit: Safe Paths) represent the next generation of tools for disease containment in an epidemic or pandemic.

Note this section is heavily based on the white paper by MIT Private Kit: Safe Paths (http://privatekit.mit.edu/). 


## New York’s Unique Challenge
Many of us are staying at home, and when out for essential reasons, we are following the CDC’s distancing guidelines, but in a city with almost 9 million people, contact with the infected is almost inevitable. 

Further compounding the issue is the anonymity of that contact. It is unlikely that a New Yorker would be able to recount all of the other people they came in contact with while picking up their prescriptions at Duane Reade or stocking up on groceries at Morton Williams. 


## Where Flatten The Curve NYC differs from MIT Private Kit: Safe Paths?
MIT Private Kit: Safe Paths are forward looking. For MIT Private Kit, people will install and the location history commences from that point forward. 

We cannot afford to wait for that location history, and feel that with the wealth of existing location data (https://www.google.com/maps/timeline), we can expand on the principles and ideas espoused by MIT Private Kit: Safe Paths and make the adoption more ubiquitous.

The more location data of infected and uninfected individuals will make contact tracing more effective, enable better containment, and therefore flatten the curve in New York City.
